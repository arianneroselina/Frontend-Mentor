## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Visual Studio 2019

### What I learned

As this is my first ever code using CSS and HTML, I found it a bit tricky just to do the simplest commands. I spent about 2 hours just to find the right code to use, so I could center my card properly. I know that my
implementation now is not yet perfect. I haven't checked how it shows up mobile since I only use my desktop to code it, but by doing this I realized that there are still so much to learn and a course is just not enough
without real exercises.

### Continued development

I'm going to develop this even more and implement the mobile view.
